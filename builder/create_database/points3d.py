    # circular module import. Same resolution as pjt_bundles.

    # its parent instead of leaving it behind. No SQLFieldReference for the
    # same reason wire_id/bundle_id above have none -- this table can't
    # reference its own not-yet-fully-defined pjt_table from within its own
    # definition. Present on every pjt_point* table (points2d/points_peg

    # structurally identical for whatever future use needs it on the others.
